# Stage 3: Learning React Js

Project created with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

<!-- ## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm run build`

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.
